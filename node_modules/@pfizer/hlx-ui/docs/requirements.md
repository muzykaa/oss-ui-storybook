# Requirements

During the development of the 'OSS Internal Webcomponents' library, the following key requirements should be taken into consideration to ensure its effectiveness, efficiency, and user-friendliness.

### Consistency:
Ensure a consistent look, feel, and behavior across all components for a unified user experience.
### Responsive Design:
Components should adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktop monitors.

As a first step, it was decided to use only one breakpoint: **991px**. Smaller screens are displaying mobile view of the components all other screens greater or equal to **991px** to display desktop view.

### Accessibility:
Adhere to the latest WCAG guidelines to ensure accessibility for all users, including those with disabilities.

*Need some additional refinements and will be updated in the future.*

### Reusability:
Components should be designed for reuse in different contexts within a Vue 3 application. Ensure components can be integrated and adapted in various parts of a Vue 3 application without extensive modifications.
### Performance Optimization:
Efficient code to minimize load times and resource usage.

*Need some additional refinements and will be updated in the future.*

### Comprehensive Documentation:
Clear, concise documentation covering all aspects of using the components, including examples. The documentation should be regularly updated to reflect changes in the library.
### Interactive Examples:
Provide interactive examples or a playground where developers can test and see components in action. These examples should be easily accessible and editable to encourage experimentation.
### Unit Testing:
Comprehensive unit tests for each component to ensure reliability and stability.

Components and utility functions must be covered by tests. Minimum coverage threshold is **75%** (as per Pfizer requirements). For testing components will use [**Vitest**](https://vitest.dev/) and [**Jest**](https://jestjs.io/) for test utilities.

### Cross-Browser Testing:
For increase stability in transpile will support at least last **5 major versions** of popular browsers.

### Build System Compatibility:
Ensure compatibility with Vue 3 build tools (Vite or Vue CLI).
### Tree Shaking Support:
Support for tree shaking to allow users to include only the components they need in their build. This helps in reducing the final bundle size for applications using the library.
### Internationalization (i18n):
Support for internationalization to allow easy translation of components.

Developers must add props or slots for every text inside component to increase flexibility.  

### Animation and Transition Support:
Components with behaviour must have proper interactions. Animations are not in priority or requirements but can be added according to wishes of developer and must not have impact to performance.

### External Dependencies:
Third-party libraries are to be used very carefully, in order to prevent potential issues with performance, security, and long-term maintenance, among other concerns.  
Only [MIT Licenced](https://opensource.org/locense/mit) libraries are allowed
