# Welcome to the OSS UI Components Library üëã

According to the project's development plan, we need to create a UI component library, that could be used for development other internal OSS websites.

This library uses [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) to author web components, and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is used to preview, browse, and prototype with OSS components.

## Using Helix Web Components in Your Projects

We host the this library on our [npm mirror](https://npm.pkg.github.com/) under the package name `@pfizer/helix-web-components`.

1. We control access to the Mirror using GitHub teams. Please make sure your GitHub account is part of one of the Github teams that has access to the Mirror.

1. Generate a GitHub Access Token with these permissions: `read:org`, `read:user`, `read:packages`, `repo` and make sure SSO is enabled for it.

1. Log into the Mirror website using your GitHub User Name and the Access Token.

1. Log into the Mirror from the command line using your GitHub User Name and the Access Token:

    ```sh
    npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
    ```

1. Add the registry property to your project‚Äôs `.npmrc` file:

    ```
    @pfizer:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
    ```

1. Use `npm` commands as normal:

    ```sh
    npm install --save-exact *will be proided later*
    ```

The `npm` command pulls dependencies from the NPM Mirror by default. The `npm` command falls back to public registries if it doesn't find the dependency on the Mirror.
