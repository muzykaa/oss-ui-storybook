# TableView

## Overview
Component "Tableview" provides a dynamic and interactive way to display tabular data inside applications. 

This component simplifies the process of creating data tables with features such as sorting, filtering, and pagination. 

It enhances the user experience by allowing seamless organization and exploration of large datasets. 

## Responsive
TableView will scroll horizontally if columns with will be greater than possible place in container.

## Customization
As a developer you can leave component "as is", just provide config for columns and dataset. Then table will render data values as simple text. 

You can customize as directly cell as entire row. For row customizing you can use slot with a static name ```item```, but if you want to customize cell - name of slot will be ```cell-*```. Where ```*``` - it`s name of wanted column. Inside each of slot you can retrieve slot props with only row or cell with row data.
